# Rain Detection Mizuri

## About The Project

I once woke up at night when my whole room was flooted with water.
The purpose of this IoT project is to detect rain and send push notifications to the user's phone so that it never rains inside. 
Those push notifications are realized via the <a href="https://pushover.net"/>Pushover API</a>.

The next step is a motor that automatically closes the window through which it rains.

## Code Details

The project was initializied via the VsCode extention PlatformIO. It's an easy way of working with Arduino stuff in VsCode.

## Requierements

- ESP32 (Wifi Dev Kit V1)
- Arduino Rain Sensor (e.g. Modul FC-37)
- servomotor (for an upcoming feature)
- 3D Printer for the case

## Case 3D Model
